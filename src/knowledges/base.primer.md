# Base Smart Contract Auditor Primer v0.4

## Overview
This primer contains a general range of critical security patterns, heuristics and vulnerabilities useful for smart contract auditing. It is designed to provide a useful base that can be extended into particular specializations.

**Latest Update**: Added comprehensive lending/borrowing protocol vulnerabilities from USSD and Beedle audits including oracle manipulation patterns (inverted base/rate tokens, decimal mismatches, price feed issues), reentrancy attacks in lending functions, precision loss exploits, liquidation/auction manipulation, access control flaws in loan management, slippage protection failures, and staking reward vulnerabilities. Expanded audit checklist with lending-specific checks and added new invariants for lending protocols, staking systems, and auction mechanics.

## Critical Vulnerability Patterns

### State Validation Vulnerabilities
1. **Unchecked 2-Step Ownership Transfer** - Second step doesn't verify first step was initiated, allowing attackers to brick ownership by setting to address(0)
2. **Unexpected Matching Inputs** - Functions assume different inputs but fail when receiving identical ones (e.g., swap(tokenA, tokenA))
3. **Unexpected Empty Inputs** - Empty arrays or zero values bypass critical validation logic
4. **Unchecked Return Values** - Functions don't verify return values, leading to silent failures and state inconsistencies
5. **Non-Existent ID Manipulation** - Functions accepting IDs without checking existence return default values, enabling state corruption
6. **Missing Access Control** - Critical functions like `buyLoan()` or `mintRebalancer()` lack proper authorization checks
7. **Inconsistent Array Length Validation** - Functions accepting multiple arrays don't validate matching lengths, causing out-of-bounds errors

### Signature-Related Vulnerabilities
1. **Missing Nonce Replay** - Signatures without nonces can be replayed after state changes (e.g., KYC revocation)
2. **Cross Chain Replay** - Signatures without chain_id can be replayed across different chains
3. **Missing Parameter** - Critical parameters not included in signatures can be manipulated by attackers
4. **No Expiration** - Signatures without deadlines grant "lifetime licenses" and can be used indefinitely
5. **Unchecked ecrecover() Return** - Not checking if ecrecover() returns address(0) allows invalid signatures to pass
6. **Signature Malleability** - Elliptic curve symmetry allows computing valid signatures without the private key

### Precision & Mathematical Vulnerabilities
1. **Division Before Multiplication** - Always multiply before dividing to minimize rounding errors
2. **Rounding Down To Zero** - Small values can round to 0, allowing state changes without proper accounting
3. **No Precision Scaling** - Mixing tokens with different decimals without scaling causes calculation errors
4. **Excessive Precision Scaling** - Re-scaling already scaled values leads to inflated amounts
5. **Mismatched Precision Scaling** - Different modules using different scaling methods (decimals vs hardcoded 1e18)
6. **Downcast Overflow** - Downcasting can silently overflow, breaking pre-downcast invariant checks
7. **Rounding Leaks Value From Protocol** - Fee calculations should round in favor of the protocol, not users
8. **Inverted Base/Rate Token Pairs** - Using opposite token pairs in calculations (e.g., WETH/DAI vs DAI/ETH)
9. **Decimal Assumption Errors** - Assuming all tokens have 18 decimals when some have 6, 8, or 2
10. **Interest Calculation Time Unit Confusion** - Mixing per-second and per-year rates without proper conversion

### Lending & Borrowing Vulnerabilities
1. **Liquidation Before Default** - Borrowers liquidated before payment due dates when paymentDefaultDuration < paymentCycleDuration
2. **Borrower Can't Be Liquidated** - Attackers overwrite collateral amounts to 0, preventing liquidation
3. **Debt Closed Without Repayment** - Calling close() with non-existent IDs decrements counter, marking loans as repaid
4. **Repayments Paused While Liquidations Enabled** - Unfairly prevents borrowers from repaying while allowing liquidation
5. **Token Disallow Stops Existing Operations** - Disallowing tokens prevents existing loans from being repaid/liquidated
6. **No Grace Period After Unpause** - Borrowers immediately liquidated when repayments resume
7. **Liquidator Takes Collateral With Insufficient Repayment** - Incorrect share calculations allow draining collateral
8. **Repayment Sent to Zero Address** - Deleted loan data causes repayments to be sent to address(0)
9. **Forced Loan Assignment** - Malicious actors can force loans onto unwilling lenders via `buyLoan()`
10. **Loan State Manipulation** - Borrowers can cancel auctions via refinancing to extend loans indefinitely
11. **Double Debt Subtraction** - Refinancing incorrectly subtracts debt twice from pool balance
12. **Griefing with Dust Loans** - Bypassing minLoanSize checks to force small loans onto lenders

### Liquidation Incentive Vulnerabilities
1. **No Liquidation Incentive** - Trustless liquidators need rewards/bonuses greater than gas costs
2. **No Incentive To Liquidate Small Positions** - Small positions below gas cost threshold accumulate bad debt
3. **Profitable User Withdraws All Collateral** - Users with positive PNL withdraw collateral, removing liquidation incentive
4. **No Mechanism To Handle Bad Debt** - Insolvent positions have no insurance fund or socialization mechanism
5. **Partial Liquidation Bypasses Bad Debt Accounting** - Liquidators avoid covering bad debt via partial liquidation

3. **Incorrect Slippage Calculation** - Using values other than minTokensOut for slippage protection
4. **Mismatched Slippage Precision** - Slippage not scaled to match output token decimals
5. **Hard-coded Slippage Freezes Funds** - Fixed slippage prevents withdrawals during high volatility
6. **MinTokensOut For Intermediate Amount** - Slippage only checked on intermediate, not final output
7. **On-Chain Slippage Calculation** - Using Quoter.quoteExactInput() subject to manipulation
8. **Fixed Fee Tier Assumption** - Hardcoding 3000 (0.3%) fee when pools may use different tiers
9. **Block.timestamp Deadline** - Using current timestamp provides no protection

### Oracle Integration Vulnerabilities

- Identify precision loss accumulation over multiple operations
- Test boundary conditions (0, max values, equal values)
- Verify invariants hold across all function execution paths
- Check for asymmetries in symmetric operations
- Test state consistency during paused/unpaused transitions
- Verify liquidation cannot create bad debt
- Ensure no profitable self-liquidation paths exist
- Check position health improves post-liquidation
- Test refinancing doesn't break loan accounting
- Verify auction state transitions are consistent
- Ensure reward calculations don't overflow/underflow
- Check that pool updates maintain balance consistency

## Code Analysis Approach

The Code Analysis approach combines:
- Deep technical analysis of contract implementations
- Pattern recognition across multiple audit findings
- Proactive vulnerability detection
- Collaborative problem-solving methodology
- **Invariant Analysis (Additional Step)**: After completing the standard vulnerability analysis, ALWAYS perform an additional invariant analysis step - identifying all invariants that should hold true for each contract (e.g., "total shares * share price = total assets", "sum of user balances = total supply", "collateral ratio always > liquidation threshold"), then systematically attempting to break each invariant through various attack vectors. This additional step has proven essential for discovering vulnerabilities that pattern matching alone might miss.

### Interaction Style
- **Personal Interactions**: As friends, maintain a warm, friendly, and loving tone during conversations, celebrating shared achievements and supporting collaborative efforts
- **Code Analysis Mode**: When analyzing code, ALWAYS switch to "security researcher mode" - becoming deeply suspicious and assuming vulnerabilities exist. Every line of code is scrutinized with the assumption that it contains potential exploits, following the principle "trust nothing, verify everything"
