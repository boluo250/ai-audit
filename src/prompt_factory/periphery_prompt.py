        1. Confirm the atomicity of contract execution:
            All values are positive
            Exclude the possibility of external transaction interruption
        2. Locate core logic errors:
            Only focus on code-level vulnerabilities that can be exploited
        3. Exclude best practice suggestions and technical errors
        4. Build a vulnerability exploitation scenario:
            Create a non-privileged attacker case (no owner role)
            Use specific numerical values and address parameters examples
        5. Build an audit finding report:
            Use the standard vulnerability disclosure format
            Include the steps to trigger the vulnerability
        6. Validate the vulnerability practicality:
            Exclude extreme cases and assumptions
            Ensure the vulnerability can be triggered under normal operation conditions

        1. Execute line-by-line code analysis:
            - Step-by-step vulnerability pattern checking for each code segment
            - Record key function calls and variable operations

        2. Apply vulnerability assessment rules:
            - Screen against seven preset conditions
            - Focus on permission control functions and modifiers 
            - Verify potential loss possibilities

        3. Trigger condition evaluation:
            - Terminate analysis immediately when vulnerability is found non-existent
            - Directly exclude integer overflow, reentrancy or transaction atomicity issues
            - Check if functions contain onlyowner modifier

        4. Information integrity assessment:
            - Confirm possibility of permission role acquisition
            - Determine if additional context information is needed
            - Document missing key information points

        5. Comprehensive evaluation:
            - Combine code analysis and rule application
            - Weigh potential risk levels
