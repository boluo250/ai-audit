## Usage Examples

### Basic Vulnerability Scanning
```python
from reasoning.scanner import VulnerabilityScanner

# Initialize scanner with project audit data
scanner = VulnerabilityScanner(project_audit)

# Execute standard scanning
results = scanner.do_scan(task_manager, is_gpt4=True)
```

### Dialogue Mode Analysis
```python
import os

# Enable dialogue mode
os.environ["ENABLE_DIALOGUE_MODE"] = "true"

# Scanner will automatically use dialogue mode
results = scanner.do_scan(task_manager, filter_func=custom_filter)
```

### Custom Filtering
```python
# Define custom filter function
def high_risk_filter(task):
    return task.risk_level >= 8

# Apply custom filter during scanning
results = scanner.do_scan(
    task_manager, 
    filter_func=high_risk_filter,
    is_gpt4=True
)
```
