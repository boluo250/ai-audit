I'll analyze the issue in the `_calculateReward` function of the CudisTokenStaking contract.

# Integer Division Precision Loss in Reward Calculation

## Description
The `_calculateReward` function contains a critical mathematical error that leads to significant precision loss in reward calculations. When calculating `rewardPerSecond`, the function performs integer division that can truncate intermediate results, causing users to receive substantially fewer rewards than intended.

In the standard calculation path:
```solidity
rewardPerSecond = amount * apy / (BASIS_POINTS * annualSeconds);
```

When `amount * apy` is smaller than `BASIS_POINTS * annualSeconds` (which equals `10000 * 31536000 = 315,360,000,000`), the division results in zero due to Solidity's integer arithmetic truncation. This means small stakes or low APY configurations could result in zero rewards even when mathematically they should receive some reward.

## Impact
- Users with small stake amounts or in low APY plans receive zero or significantly reduced rewards
- The precision loss systematically underpays users, violating the protocol's reward promises
- The effect is cumulative over time and more severe for shorter staking periods
- The contract's rounding logic cannot recover from precision already lost in the initial calculation

## Recommendation
Implement higher precision arithmetic by rearranging the calculation to perform multiplication before division:

```solidity
function _calculateReward(uint256 amount, uint256 apy, uint256 duration) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 annualSeconds = 365 days;
    
    // Perform multiplication first to maintain precision
    uint256 rawReward = (amount * apy * duration) / (BASIS_POINTS * annualSeconds);
    
    // Apply rounding logic to rawReward
    // ... rounding implementation
    
    return roundedReward;
}
```

This modification ensures mathematical accuracy and prevents systematic reward underpayment, especially for users with smaller stake amounts or in lower APY plans.
